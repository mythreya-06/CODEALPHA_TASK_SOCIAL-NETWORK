This is a simple social network webpage built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It consists of four main sections:

Profile Section: Allows users to update their name, email, and password via a form.
Posts Section: Users can create posts by entering content in a textarea and submitting it. The posts are displayed in a container.
Friends Section: Displays a list of friends and allows users to send friend requests by entering an email.
Settings Section: Users can update their privacy settings by selecting either "Public" or "Private."
The webpage includes navigation links, and JavaScript (in script.js) is likely used to handle form submissions, display posts, and manage interactions dynamically. The styles are applied via an external CSS file (styles.css) to improve the layout and design.
